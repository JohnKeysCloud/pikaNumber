# pikaNumber

The first game I've ever made! Ù©(â—•â€¿â—•ï½¡)Û¶
Written in vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript with love & care!

Whilst learning JavaScript, this is my first project involving some in vanilla form :)

Testing out what I can do without references to establish a solid memory of JavaScripts fundamentals.

I started this project; However, and DID Google how to achieve certain interactibilties (functions & what not) included in the project... and inevitably deep dove into fully undertanding the abstract concepts associated with said interactibilities.

It's a simple number guessing game.
Pikachu will pick one of the 3 choices at random

if (yourNumber = pikachusNumber) {
  alert('You Win!');
} 

Built & designed simultaneously.
Intended to display my creative ability in terms of full front-end design (UX/UI)â€¦ without the use of a framework.
AAA+ compliant (I think anyway lol), High performance & SEO optimized :)

100%, hand-typed (No Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V's).
No templates used & no outside inspiration for the responsive design.

DISCLAIMER: This project was created to demonstrate my abilities. I am in no way affilaited with the PokÃ©mon company...
Though I should be lol...

Thanks for checking it out!
