# pikaNumber

The first game I've ever made! Ù©(â—•â€¿â—•ï½¡)Û¶

Learning JavaScript currently, so this will be my first project involving some.

It's a simple number guessing game.
Pikachu will pick one of the 3 choices at random
â€¦and if you guess it correctly, you win :)

Written in vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript with love!
No templates used & no outside inspiration for the responsive design.
Built also to display my creative ability in terms of front-end design (UX/UI) without the use of a framework.
100%, my own code.

Thanks for checking it out!
